# Telecom Customer Churn Analysis:-

## Project Overview:-
This project aims to identify patterns and predictors of customer churn within a telecom company using Python. 
By analyzing customer demographics, service usage, and account information, it uncovers insights that can drive
retention strategies and reduce customer loss.

## Objectives:-
- Explore customer data to identify churn drivers
- Build predictive models to estimate churn risk
- Visualize trends and insights using Python libraries
- Provide actionable recommendations for retention
  
## Tech Stack:-
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook (for analysis and experimentation)
  
## Key Analytical Focus:-
- Churn Rate Analysis — % of customers leaving
- Demographic Breakdown — age, gender, tenure
- Service Usage — internet plans, streaming, device protection
- Financial Insights — monthly charges, total revenue lost
- Predictive Modeling — logistic regression, decision trees, random forest
